Frankenstein.jl 🧠⚡
==================

The Monster Solver Algorithm™ — compositional, adaptive, and nearly sentient. Built from the best stiff and non-stiff solvers in the Julia ecosystem, Frankenstein dynamically assembles the ideal solver strategy for your problem using intelligent heuristics and modular adaptation.

What is Frankenstein.jl?
-------------------------
Frankenstein.jl is a black-box ODE solver that works seamlessly with DifferentialEquations.jl:

    sol = solve(prob, Frankenstein())

Rather than reinventing integration methods, Frankenstein stitches together:

- Best-in-class Julia solvers (e.g. Tsit5, Rodas5, KenCarp4, CVODE)
- Smart adaptation strategies (memory-based, hybrid, convergence-aware)
- Backend selectors and preconditioners
- Automated problem analysis: stiffness, sparsity, scaling
